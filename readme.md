# Motorbug - the open 360&deg; platforming engine

This is a 360&deg; ("sonic-style") platformer engine completely written in JavaScript and HTML5 allowing you to develop this style of platforming games for the Open Web.

## features

* 360&deg; Genesis-style Sonic physics.
* Sound effects via HTML5 audio
* Controller support (through the JS Gamepad API) (beta)
* touch controls support (beta)

## Why "Motorbug"?

If you can't tell, this engine was highly insipred by the classic Sonic the Hedgehog games. In these games, there was an easy enemy called a "motobug." I thought this fit the engine pretty well, as it allowed you to "motor" along, and (at least for now) it has a lot of "bugs." XD

Also, adding the "r" allows me to differentiate Motorbug from the Sonic enemy, and hopefully not get sued for use of the name. (fingers crossed!)

Yes, I know that sounds stupid.

## How is this different from other "sonic-style" engines?

a number of different engines exist that do quite similar things to Motorbug. The most notable of these (off the top of my head) is the Sonic Worlds engine. This is a quite fully-featured and well-tested engine, and is much better than Motorbug in most cases. However, to fully utilize this engine, you need to install Multimedia Fusion 2 (MMF2), which costs money.

Motorbug, while quite a bit more buggy than Sonic Worlds, depends only on the open HTML5 & JavaScript standards, which means it can be played in any modern browser (including mobile, as far as I know).

There are other implementations of sonic physics in the (like [this](http://oursonic.org))

## Media and Resources

Since I am not the best artist, I have used art and graphics from SEGA as well as various other fan artists on the internet:
* Sonic and related sprites are from the ModGen project
* Shadow and related sprites are from Cylent Nite
* Silver and relates sprites are from the S-Factor, a hack by Aquaslash
* Tiles for the first level are modified from various official sonic games, and thus belong to SEGA. Those for Crystal Geyser are original and belong to me. You can use them under a CC-BY-SA license. 
* the beach background, springs, rings, and spikes were made by me! (you can use them under the CC-BY-SA as well)
* sound effects and music were also made by me! (you can use these too, just give credit to Coderman64)
* if there are any sprites here that I didn't credit, they are likely from spriters-resource.com/ and originally came from original sonic games. Thus, they are probably &copy; SEGA.

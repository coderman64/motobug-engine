## characters

many of the sprites here (i.e. for sonic, shadow, and silver) were simply intermediates in creating bigger, single sprite sheets for each character.

I couldn't use the original sprite sheets, because motobug currently requires the sprites to be evenly spaced to create a good animation. This could be changed later, as could anything.
